Smart Agricultural Land Reclamation & Water Access System
Overview
This project aims to address food security and water access in Africa by leveraging blockchain and AI technologies. Built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), the system integrates Rust for the backend (smart contracts and APIs) and React for the frontend (user interface).

Features
Land Analysis: AI-driven recommendations for reclaiming degraded lands.
Blockchain-based Land Registry: Tokenized ownership records.
Water Access Management: Monitoring borehole usage and managing water credits.
Crowdfunding Platform: Secure, transparent funding for land and water projects.
Tech Stack
Backend:
Rust (for ICP canisters)
ICP (blockchain infrastructure)
Frontend:
React (TypeScript, Material-UI/TailwindCSS)
Deployed as an asset canister on ICP
AI Integration:
Hosted externally and accessed via ICP HTTP outcalls
Database:
Stable memory in ICP canisters and IPFS for large file storage
Getting Started
